# Functional API Demo with Keras

This repository demonstrates the use of Keras' Functional API to build multi-input and multi-output models. The examples include: 
1. A simple multi-output model.
2. A more advanced model with two input branches and a combined output.

## Features

- **Multi-Output Model:** A single input model with two outputs using different activation functions.
- **Multi-Input Model:** A model with two input branches, combined into a single output.
- Visualizes the model architecture using `plot_model` from Keras.

## Requirements

To run this code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (>= 2.x)
- Keras
- Matplotlib (for plotting the model architecture)

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib
